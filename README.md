# Airport-API

The Airport API service, built on Django REST, is specifically crafted to 
monitor flights originating from airports globally. Providing comprehensive 
details on airports, planes, flights, routes, and beyond, this API functions 
as a powerful tool for effectively managing and analyzing data associated 
with air travel.


## Installing using GitHub

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
 - Install PostgresSQL and create db
 - Python3 must be already installed. 

## Run the project locally without Docker

## Installed

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sparix/Airport-API
```
2. Go to the project directory:
```shell
cd Airport_API
```
3. Create a virtual Python engine and activate it:
```shell
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate(on macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate(on Windows)
```
4. Set the project assignments:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration Environment Variables:
  - Create a file named .env, using .env.sample as an example.
  - Make sure you have replaced all the dummy keys with your actual data.

```shell
set SECRET_KEY=< secret_key >
set POSTGRES_HOST=< db_host_name >
set POSTGRES_DB=< db_name >
set POSTGRES_USER=< db_username >
set POSTGRES_PASSWORD=< password_db >
```

## Starting the server
1. Create database migrations:
```shell
python maange.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Load data to db:
```shell
python manage.py loaddata data_base.json
```

3. Start the development server:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

The API should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000/

## RUN with Docker

Docker should b—É installed

```shell
docker-compose build
```
```shell
docker-compose up
```
